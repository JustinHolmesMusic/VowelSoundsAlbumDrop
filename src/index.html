                    <strong><i>Vowel Sounds</i></strong> is the debut album-length offering from Justin Myles
                    Holmes.
                    <br><br>
                    Recorded in Nashville with a hand-picked ensemble of award-winning bluegrass session musicians,
                    it packs a hard-driving acoustic feel along with the wind instruments and varied singing
                    techniques that have made Holmes' live shows a draw
                    at blockchain events around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    The album will be released on the Ethereum blockchain using <a

                    "Vowel Sounds is a masterful weaving of twangy bluegrass music and poetic lyrics about
                    power
                    structures, society, cryptography, trust, and community. If you like bluegrass or folk music,
                    then this album is great listening on that basis alone.. but it's also a great way to learn more
                    about
                    cryptography."

                    "Justin Holmesâ€™ new record, <i>Vowel Sounds</i>, feels like a Trans-Atlantic space journey into
                    its very own aural world. With a virtuosic Bluegrass sound bed, Holmes weaves lyrical subjects
                    of planet respect, ancient vocal pedagogy, and freedom beautifully and still remains playful
                    in all its complexity. The description of vocal overtone solos explained and then employed
                    is nothing short of fascinating. Holmes has proven heâ€™s a master of fitting woodwind instruments
                    onto a traditional Bluegrass canvas with his use of tin whistle, melodica and flute which
                    impressively
                    turns each instrument into an Appalachian adjacent voice. After listen-through, Vowel Sounds leaves
                    you wanting to already hear a follow-up project from this creative and mystical human!"

                    music
                    is effortlessly fused here by Justin Holmes' innovative new album, Vowel Sounds."

                    Making music un-free hasn't made musicians un-poor. So we're carving out a way to release free,
                    IP-unencumbered music - which is after all the core of traditional music - and reward fans who
                    choose to pay for it.

                    The record is encrypted and will be available for download later today.

                    Once contributions have crossed the threshold of
                    10ETH,
                    anyone can download the encrypted record. The decryption key will be made available on the Ethereum
                    blockchain
                    using Threshold Network's Access Control (TACo). Once released, the record will be in the public
                    domain,
                    free to download and use under a creative commons license.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h3>What's the difference between a duck?</h3>
        <p class="end-of-answer">
            One leg is both the same.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Revealer exactly?</h3>
        <p>

            Revealer is a decentralized application that allows you to reveal a secret to the world via a
            commit-and-reveal
            scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is built on top of Threshold Network, and a few of the contributors to Revealer are also long-time
            contributors
            to Threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the cryptological layer, there's nothing about Revealer that is specific to the arts. However, when it
            became
            obvious
            that conditionally revealing a committed-to secret was possible because of advances at Threshold, it seemed
            that
            Create Commons-licensed art was the first obvious use case.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's fairly simple: using Threshold Access Control, a symmetric key is encrypted. A smart contract is
            deployed
            such that a boolean flag is flipped to true once a 'threshold' of contributions are made. The nodes on the
            Threshold
            Network watch for the flipping of this flag, and only then participate in their typical multi-party
            computation
            to reveal the symmetric key.
        </p>
        <p class="end-of-answer">
            At that moment, whatever the artist has encrypted with that key (int his case, a bluegrass record) becomes
            public.
        </p>

        <h3>What is an Artifact??</h3>
        <p>
            Revealer Artifacts are ERC-721 tokens that are minted after contributions are closed, and awarded to
            everyone
            who contributed. They are serialized starting from 0, with lower numbers going to higher contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone who contributes above the .1eth minimum will receive an Artifact, sent to the address from which
            they
            contributed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top 11 contributors will have their Artifact bound to one of the paintings by Nashville artist Sophie
            Clark.
        </p>
        <p class="end-of-answer">
            Part of the medium-term vision of Threshold Network is to use NFTs to unlock access to content, and these
            Artifacts
            are intended to be used for that purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is there a minimum contribution amount? Can I contribute less?</h3>
        <p>
            The primary reason to establish a minimum contribution amount is to prevent spamming of small contributions
            in order to farm Artifacts. The Artifacts are intended to be special, and part of the long-term ecosystem of
            Justin's music.
        </p>
        <p class="end-of-answer">
            However, if you want to contribute and don't care about getting an Artifact, you can simply send ETH
            straight to
            the
            contract address.
            This will count toward unlocking the record, but won't be recorded as an official contribution on the
            leaderboard,
            etc.
        </p>


        <h3>How long do I have to contribute?</h3>
        <p>
            Until 10eth are raised, or 14 days have elapsed - whichever happens last.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if, at any time, there are less than 24 hours remaining, any contribution will cause the clock
            to be set to 24 hours from that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The record will be released when contributions reach 10ETH, regardless of whether the 14 days have passed.
        </p>
        <p class="end-of-answer">
            The 14-day window and 24-hour extension are parameterized - future Revealers can have different values.
        </p>
